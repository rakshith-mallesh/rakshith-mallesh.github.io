    <h1>What can you do about Climate Change?</h1>

    <p>If you are concerned about climate change and the environment, you can start doing something about it!
        Reducing your impact on the planet doesn’t have to be hard, time-consuming, or inconvenient. 
        The idea is to do as much as one possibly can. Remember, it is not too late for us to solve the 
        climate crisis. To make environmental progress, we need to work with those acting in the same 
        direction. Thinking “It is too late to do something about climate change” is almost as bad as 
        denying climate change. It is also worth remembering that individual action and policy/governmental
        changes can go hand in hand, it need not be one or the other.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of things (roughly ordered high-impact to low-impact) that are specific,
        that one can do. Most of them are self-explanatory but scroll below for more info. I compiled this 
        list for myself, but if one other person on the internet finds it useful, I am more than happy.</p>


        <h2>The big picture changes</h2>
    <ul>
        These are some of the most impactful things you can do:
        <li>Research and vote responsibly. It is very important to check which representatives support 
            environmental bills, and how much they believe in climate change.</li>
        <li>Store your money in sustainable banks. Most big banks lend billions of dollars each year
            to fossil fuel companies, thus indirectly contributing to climate change. See 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ7W6HFHPYs&t=145s" target="_blank">this</a> 
            explainer video by Rollie Williams on how this works. Local credit unions 
            are a great option. Avoid investing in crypto (at least for now) as it is environmentally 
            destructive.</li>
        <li>Eat more plants! As simple as this sounds, multiple studies have shown that 
        including more plant-based foods is one of the single-biggest ways to reduce your carbon footprint.</li>

        <figure>
        <img src="foods footprint.png" alt="Image description" style="max-width:60%; height:auto;">
        </figure>
        <li>Find a job in a company helping to combat climate change. 
            <a href="https://leventov.medium.com/how-to-find-a-job-in-a-tech-company-helping-to-combat-climate-change-practical-guide-e212e262a32" target="_blank">Here</a> is 
            a guide on how to do this is if you’re in IT, and <a href="https://climatebase.org/" target="_blank">here</a> is a platform to discover climate jobs. If you are in physics,
            <a href="https://romps.berkeley.edu/advice/" target="_blank">here</a> is some excellent advice by Prof. David Romps (UC Berkeley) on how you can apply
            your talents to the problem of climate change.</li>
        <li>Avoid flying, take the train or bus instead. Cycling, walking, and public transport are the most environmentally friendly ways to
        go around. Bicycles are about 5 times more efficient than walking and 50 times more efficient than cars!</li>

    </ul>

    Now that we have covered the most impactful steps one can take, we can look at some other smaller things one can do:
    
    <h2>Fossil Fuel Emissions</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>If you must fly book a direct flight rather than one with a stopover, pack light, lower the shades, and open the vents while on the plane.</li>
        <li>Combine multiple reasons for travel.&nbsp;If possible, extend your trip so that it fulfills multiple purposes.</li>
        <li>If you have a choice, live close to where you work, shop, and send your kids to school.</li>
        <li>Switch to an electric, CNG, or hybrid vehicle if you can afford to. Opt for a lightweight vehicle that is fuel efficient at the very least, even if gas-powered. 
            Prefer motorcycles or scooters if traveling alone.</li>
        <li>If you own a vehicle, there are some things you can do to increase its efficiency:
            <ul class="wp-block-list">
            <li>Switch off vehicle engine at red lights and railway crossings.</li>
            <li>Drive in the correct gear, i.e, the highest gear possible. Keep your foot off the clutch when not changing gears.</li>
            <li>Remove excess weight from your vehicle.</li>
            <li>Roll up your windows and use the AC only when necessary.</li>
            <li>If possible, avoid traffic jams and choose fuel-efficient routes (Google Maps shows you fuel-efficient routes).</li>
            <li>Drive smoothly without sudden acceleration or braking and avoid excessive speeds.</li>
            <li>Keep a check on the tire pressure, it should be optimum.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Carpool whenever possible with friends and other people traveling to the same place, and choose options like Ola share instead of going alone in a cab.</li>
        <li>Plan your vacations close to your home.</li>
        <li>Avoid the use of air conditioners as much as possible, or don&#8217;t buy them in the first place. Climate-friendly alternative: Heat pumps or just fans.</li>
        <li>Store all your money in sustainable banks. Avoid investing in crypto (at least for now) as it is environmentally destructive.</li>
        <li>Practice minimalism (buying less stuff in the first place) if you find it appealing.</li>
        <li>Buy products in bulk (especially non-perishables)</li>
        <li>Use natural sunlight as a light source when possible.</li>
        <li>Run outdoors instead of on a treadmill.</li>
        <li>Do not let pets defecate in public places, as this can contribute to methane and nitrous oxide emissions.</li>
        <li>Change your search engine to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ecosia.org/" target="_blank">Ecosia</a>. Ecosia puts 80% of its profits into reforestation projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Kitchen</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Consume unprocessed and unpackaged foods like fruits and vegetables instead of processed and packaged ones.</li>



<li>Practice segregation of dry and wet waste at home. Compost the wet waste. The veggie scraps can be used to make vegetable broth.</li>
<li>Minimize food wastage. You can freeze excess or food that is about to expire, in the freezer. A lot of foods like fresh bread, for example, freeze and thaw well.</li>
<li>Buy “misfit” produce. Many perfectly fine produce never make it to the grocery store because they are deemed too aesthetically unappealing to sell. </li>
<li>Pressure-cook as many things in the kitchen as possible instead of boiling to save gas/ electricity. </li>



<li>Use &#8220;residual&#8221; heat when cooking.</li>



<li>Use an electric kettle to boil water in the kitchen.</li>



<li>Avoid peeling veggies whenever feasible (like carrots, ginger, potatoes, etc.) as it reduces wet waste.</li>



<li>Buy local produce from local producers.</li>



<li>Shop at the farmer&#8217;s market, so you can use reusable bags to buy vegetables, fruits, etc.</li>



<li>Buy and use cast iron cookware instead of Teflon ones because they virtually last forever.</li>



<li>Use old jam bottles and other jars for storing things in the kitchen, etc. instead of buying new containers.</li>



<li>Make bio enzymes from citrus peels to use for cleaning.</li>



<li>Buy a refrigerator that is just large enough for your needs. If possible, opt for a thermoelectric cooler instead like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.godrej.com/p/appliances/Food-Beverage-and-Cosmetic-Cooler/TEC-Qube-30L-HS-Q103-Black" target="_blank">this one</a>, which does not use refrigerants.</li>



<li>Store only the necessary things in the refrigerator, not every food item needs to be kept in cold temperatures. Some tips to reduce the impact of your refrigerator:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ensure that the chemicals in your refrigerator and AC do not leak (These chemicals are very potent greenhouse gases). If your unit is slowly losing its cool, it is likely a sign of a leak</li>



<li>Defrost fridge or freezer regularly.</li>



<li>Earthen pots can be used to cool water instead of in the refrigerator.</li>



<li>If you are upgrading your fridge, try to exchange it instead of disposing of it. This way, your old refrigerator will be recycled.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Pre-soak heavy pots and pans before washing them, this saves water and energy.</li>



<li>If you bake, go for silicone mats and muffin liners instead of parchment paper.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Electronics</h2>
    <ul>
<li>Buy refurbished or second-hand stuff (Electronics, home appliances, books, etc.) instead of brand-new ones.</li>



<li>Borrow books instead of buying them.</li>



<li>Use IT devices as long as possible and purchase new devices as seldom as possible. </li>



<li>Use devices already available at work/ school/ college instead of buying your own.</li>



<li>Opt for electronic gadgets from companies that offer good repairability. This way if something goes wrong, you can get it repaired instead of buying something entirely new. Apple is notorious for making it difficult to repair your devices.</li>



<li>Order less stuff online.</li>



<li>Keep a clean Gmail inbox, and unsubscribe from unnecessary recurring sources and mailing lists.</li>



<li>Clear your chats regularly (WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.)</li>



<li>Swap email attachments with a document link like Google Docs.</li>



<li>Download music that you often listen to instead of streaming it every time.</li>



<li>Use a phone over Wi-Fi instead of mobile data, as Wi-Fi is less resource intensive.</li>



<li>Ask for an e-bill instead of a physical copy (works at stores like Max)</li>



<li>Dispose of e-waste responsibly at e-waste drop-off bins or e-recycling units near you.</li>



<li>Buy rechargeable batteries for all your appliances that use single-use batteries. (Like clocks, TV remotes, and such)</li>



<li>Use cloud storage only when necessary and switch off unnecessary cloud backups.</li>



<li>Avoid signing up for newsletters, offer updates, etc. If you can use a service or a website without giving them your email address or phone number, do it. This way they won&#8217;t be able to send you promotional messages and spam you.</li>



<li>&nbsp;If possible, do not print lecture&nbsp;notes or other electronic documents.</li>



<li>If you have to print, set the printer default to double-sided printing. Prefer black and white printouts.</li>
    </ul>








    
    <h2>Water!</h2>
    <ul>
<li>Take cold-water baths during summer. (Does not make a difference if you have a solar water heater)</li>



<li>Install aerators on taps to save water.</li>



<li>Take bath mindfully so that you don’t overuse water. Prefer showering over using a bucket to bathe.</li>



<li>Use a bowl of water to wash vegetables instead of washing them under running tap water. This water along with the water used to wash rice and other grains throughout the day can be used to water plants.</li>



<li><em>Only for Indians:</em> Use an Indian toilet instead of a Western one, as flushing uses a lot more water.</li>



<li>Collect the wastewater from water purifiers and use it to wash or mop the floor, clean utensils, water plants, or something similar.</li>



<li>Water plants early in the morning or late evening to prevent water loss by evaporation.</li>



<li>Switch to a water purification system that wastes less water.</li>



<li>Use buckets instead of hose pipes to water plants/ floors/ vehicles.</li>



<li>Fix leaks in flushes, taps, and water pipes.</li>



<li>Drink tap water instead of bottled water.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Plastic Waste and Fashion</h2>
    <ul>
<li>Avoid fast fashion.</li>



<li>Wear the clothes that you have. You likely have a lot of great pieces already, including many that you have not worn lately.</li>



<li>Buy clothes at thrift/ factory second stores. You can find thrift and second-hand clothes online too.</li>



<li>Buy clothes made of natural fiber like cotton instead of synthetic ones.</li>



<li>Rent stuff instead of buying.</li>



<li>Donate old clothes and books.</li>



<li>Refuse freebies given out on airplanes, hotels, etc. (Like free headphones, toilet kits, etc.) and unnecessary pamphlets.</li>



<li>Use cloth bags while shopping and lunch boxes while taking parcels from the restaurant.</li>



<li>Use reusable cloth diapers for kids, and women can switch to menstrual cups or cloth pads.</li>



<li>Prefer trimming over using shaving/ using razors. If you have to shave, use reusable razors instead of plastic disposable ones.</li>



<li>Make cloth bags from old clothes and bedsheets.</li>



<li>Wash clothes in cold water and hang dry them. If you are washing them using a washing machine, use a cold water cycle.</li>



<li>Rent reusable plates, tumblers, etc. for functions, get-togethers, and such, or use biodegradable ones.</li>



<li>Have a reusable spoon, fork, and travel mug with you all the time to use whenever you would need to.</li>


<li>Avoid using plastic straws. Use a steel or bamboo one instead.</li>



<li>Use paper tape instead of plastic tape.</li>



<li>Use cloth napkins instead of tissue, paper wrapping instead of cheap shiny gift wraps.</li>



<li>Opt for bamboo toothbrushes and neem combs.</li>



<li>Buy drinks that come in reusable glass containers (Like sprite) or juice that is served in glass containers.</li>



<li>Use metal reusable razors instead of disposable plastic ones.</li>



<li>Save plastic covers and send them to services that recycle/ reuse them, like Recharka.</li>



<li>Prefer using ink pens and pencils over single-use pens.</li>



<li>Wear reusable face masks.</li>
    </ul>








    
    <h2>At Home</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Switch to green energy: Solar panels, wind, biogas, etc.</li>



<li>Install a solar water heater.</li>



<li>Use energy-efficient appliances and insulate your home.</li>



<li>Switch to an induction stove or biogas for cooking.</li>



<li>Upgrade light bulbs to LED ones.</li>



<li>Try to get rainwater harvesting infrastructure in your home/ office.</li>



<li>Repair, reuse, and recycle old furniture.</li>



<li>Recycle and reuse old newspapers, and magazines. Switch to reading the news online if possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Write your representatives and inform them about the climate-friendly changes you think could be adopted in your community.</li>



<li>Invest responsibly. This will take time and a good amount of research. If you own any stocks or mutual funds, they might be part of fossil fuel investments. You can check <a href="https://fossilfreefunds.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> if your savings are invested in fossil fuels. Also look into Green investing and Impact investing.</li>



<li>Educate yourself about the facts of climate change and talk about it whenever you get the chance. Having facts to back up your claims will help you make your case better.</li>



<li>Join a local climate action group. <a href="https://www.earthhero.org/groups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here</a> are a few to get you started.</li>



<li>Support eco-friendly businesses. This can be done by buying their products, reviewing them online, and so on.</li>



<li>If you can, adopt an animal near extinction. Check out <a href="https://support.wwf.org.uk/adoptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWF</a> or search online for local options.</li>



<li>Participate in and mobilize participation for clean-up drives of cities and water bodies. </li>



<li>Grow your own veggies and herbs.</li>



<li>Plant trees whenever you get a chance.</li>



<li>Create kitchen/ terrace gardens at your home/ office/ school.</li>
    </ul>
