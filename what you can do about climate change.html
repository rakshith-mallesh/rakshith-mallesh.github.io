    <h1>What can you do about Climate Change?</h1>

    <p>If you are concerned about climate change and the environment, you can start doing something about it!
        Reducing your impact on the planet doesn’t have to be hard, time-consuming, or inconvenient. 
        The idea is to do as much as one possibly can. Remember, it is not too late for us to solve the 
        climate crisis. To make environmental progress, we need to work with those acting in the same 
        direction. Thinking “It is too late to do something about climate change” is almost as bad as 
        denying climate change. It is also worth remembering that individual action and policy/governmental
        changes can go hand in hand, it need not be one or the other.</p>

        <p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of things (roughly ordered high-impact to low-impact) that are specific,
        that one can do. Most of them are self-explanatory but scroll below for more info. I compiled this 
        list for myself, but if one other person on the internet finds it useful, I am more than happy.</p>


        <h2>The big picture changes</h2>
    <ul>
        These are some of the most impactful things you can do:
        <li>Research and vote responsibly. It is very important to check which representatives support 
            environmental bills, and how much they believe in climate change.</li>
        <li>Store your money in sustainable banks. Most big banks lend billions of dollars each year
            to fossil fuel companies, thus indirectly contributing to climate change. See 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ7W6HFHPYs&t=145s" target="_blank">this</a> 
            explainer video by Rollie Williams on how this works. Local credit unions 
            are a great option. Avoid investing in crypto (at least for now) as it is environmentally 
            destructive.</li>
        <li>Eat more plants! As simple as this sounds, multiple studies have shown that 
        including more plant-based foods is one of the single-biggest ways to reduce your carbon footprint.</li>

        <li>Find a job in a company helping to combat climate change.

            a guide on how to do this is if you’re in IT, and <a href="https://climatebase.org/" target="_blank">here</a> is a platform to discover climate jobs. If you are in physics,
            <a href="https://romps.berkeley.edu/advice/" target="_blank">here</a> is some excellent advice by Prof. David Romps (UC Berkeley) on how you can apply
            your talents to the problem of climate change.</li>
